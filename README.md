VulnTrain offers a suite of commands to generate diverse AI datasets and train models using
comprehensive vulnerability data from [Vulnerability-Lookup](https://github.com/vulnerability-lookup/vulnerability-lookup).
It harnesses over one million JSON records from all supported advisory sources to build high-quality, domain-specific models.
  
Additionally, data from the ``vulnerability-lookup:meta`` container, including enrichment sources such as vulnrichment and Fraunhofer FKIE,
is incorporated to enhance model quality.

Check out the datasets and models on Hugging Face:

For more information about the use of AI in Vulnerability-Lookup, please refer to the
[user manual](https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org/user-manual/ai/).


## Usage

Install VulnTrain:

```bash
$ pipx install VulnTrain
```

Three types of commands are available:

- **Dataset generation**: Create and prepare datasets.
- **Model training**: Train models using the prepared datasets.
  - Train a model to **classify** vulnerabilities by severity. [![Model on HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/model-on-hf-sm-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/CIRCL/vulnerability-severity-classification-roberta-base)
  - Train a model for **text generation** to assist in writing vulnerability descriptions [![Model on HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/model-on-hf-sm-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/CIRCL/vulnerability-description-generation-gpt2#how-to-get-started-with-the-model)
- **Model validation**: Assess the performance of trained models.
